# milo.js
A tiny React-like VDOM rendering library

## Background
I'm personally a big fan of the wonderful [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com) framework,
particularly for its tiny footprint and fast 
[rendering speed](http://www.stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark7/table.html).
However, I also believe that the declarative style of React and the frameworks it 
has inspired can greatly improve the maintainablity of modern web applications.

milo.js is an attempt to make a VDOM rendering library which might be feasable for a
[website weighing under 10Kb](https://a-k-apart.com/).

## The name

[Milo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_(drink)) happens to be a kind of malt drink
powder popular in Australia which happens to go well with vanilla ice cream.
